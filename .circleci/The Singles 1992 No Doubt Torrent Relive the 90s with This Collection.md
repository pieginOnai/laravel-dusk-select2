Here are some more paragraphs for the article:
 
No Doubt was formed in 1986 in Anaheim, California, by siblings Eric and Gwen Stefani, along with John Spence and Jerry McMahon. The band initially played ska music and performed at local venues. After Spence's suicide in 1987, the band recruited Adrian Young as their drummer and Tony Kanal as their bassist. They also added horn players and keyboardists to their lineup. The band released their self-titled debut album in 1992, but it was largely ignored by the public and the critics.
 
The band's breakthrough came in 1995 with their third album, Tragic Kingdom, which spawned seven singles and sold over 16 million copies worldwide. The album was influenced by Gwen Stefani's breakup with Tony Kanal, as well as by the band's exposure to different musical genres. The album's success catapulted No Doubt to fame and earned them several awards and nominations, including two Grammy Awards. The band became known for their energetic live performances and their distinctive fashion sense.
 
The band's fourth album, Return of Saturn, was released in 2000, after a four-year hiatus. The album was more mature and introspective than their previous work, reflecting the band's personal and professional struggles. The album received positive reviews from critics, but did not match the commercial success of Tragic Kingdom. The band then experimented with dancehall and synth-pop sounds on their fifth album, Rock Steady, which was released in 2001. The album was well received by critics and fans alike, and produced four singles, including the Grammy-winning "Hey Baby" and "Underneath It All".
